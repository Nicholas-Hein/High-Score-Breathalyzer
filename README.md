# High Score Breathalyzer

An Atmega328p based embedded systems project to create your very own High Score Breathalyzer!

Delight your friends by having them compete to set the high score BAC for your breathalyzer.  As a fun party toy, this circuit is meant to augment the enjoyment of drinking with friends by throwing in some friendly competition.

## Features:
- Measure your BAC with the MQ-3: an accurate, analog ethanol concentration sensor.
- Control your breathalyzer using the High Score Breathalyzer app on your phone.
- Save your score to the scoreboard on the app.
- Save your high scores across devices by saving to the Atmega328p's FIFO.

## Disclaimers:
- This code is very preliminary, and there are a few known bugs.
- I will include circuit diagrams and pin-outs.
- I will create a step-by-step instruction manual on how I assembled and flashed the circuit.
- **This is not an excuse for heavy drinking, and I do not accept any liability for whoever uses these resources**.
- _However, this toy **could** be used as a tool to measure BAC and promote healthy drinking habits (e.g. stop someone from driving home)._
- Enjoy! These resources are for anybody! Modify, create, or reference, but I would appreciate a little credit when necessary :wink:.
